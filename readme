I'm creating a 1-click checkout plugin for woocommerce, similar to Fast.co Checkout

give me the code to create a woocommerce plugin that:

1. Prepare the pasics (name and requirements).
   Before you start working with the actual code and files of your plugin, you'll want to do a little work to prepare the basics.

First, you'll want to clearly work out the requirements for your plugin before you start coding. Here are some common questions that you should be able to answer:

What are the features of the plugin?
--Should display a button on product page and checkout pay called pay in 1 click, near the add to cart button
--When clicked, it should add query params to a link: checkout.veryfast.com/ src=wc&merchantId&productId&qty=1&cartId=
--It should create an overlay after clicked
--The overlay should display the payment link in an iframe

React side:
-Payment link will fetch the productId from the query params
-it will display in cart
-after address is entered it will display available shipping methods

Express side:
-/getProduct route -> should fetch product data and locate with id
-/createOrder route -> after clicks checkcout, will create order
-/getStatus route -> will set order as compleete if success ,r will set order is failed

How will users control those features?
--The users will click

What input does the plugin need to accept from users?
--A product add to cart or click on the pay in 1 click button on the product page
What will the front-end design look like (if applicable)?
--Fast checkout
Will the plugin integrate with other plugins or services?
--The plugin will integrate with woocommerce
What potential compatibility issues might the plugin have?
--new woocommmerce version( new checkout APIs )

what i will do:
-pass the product id inside the link
-get the product id, data, from express
-get the data above, and insert into cart
