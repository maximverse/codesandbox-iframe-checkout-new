I'm creating a 1-click checkout plugin for woocommerce, similar to Fast.co Checkout

give me the code to create a woocommerce plugin that:

1. Prepare the pasics (name and requirements).
   Before you start working with the actual code and files of your plugin, you'll want to do a little work to prepare the basics.

First, you'll want to clearly work out the requirements for your plugin before you start coding. Here are some common questions that you should be able to answer:

chatgpt:
I want the code to build a 1-click checkout plugin for woocommerce stores. The code has to be complete, with no errors.
Description:
I want to build a 1-click checkout product plugin simillar to Fast.co Checkout, or Rallyon checkout.

Features of the plugin:
--Admin side below:
-Admin panel: it should have a menu where the admin would go.
-The menu button when clicked should show a page with an input field and a button called save
-the input field is made so the admin enters an API Key manually, the save button is that the api key must be saved
-once the button is clicked saved, the key from the input field should be saved and it should store it.
--Admin side end
--Payer side:
-On the product page, near the add to cart button, there should be another button called "Pay in 1 click"
-On the cart page, the original woocommerce checkout button should be replaced with a button called pay in 1 click
-When a customer goes on the product page of a woocommerce site, he should click on the pay in 1click button,
-when clicked, it should create an overlay:

1. a container that fills the whole screen, that is black with an opacity of 0.5
2. inside that container, there should be an iframe with the link below that should fill the screen.
3. -When clicked, it should add query params to a link (here's an example below):
   https://checkout.veryfast.com/?currency=USD&merchantId=(the_api_key_from_the_admin_panel)&src=wc&items=
   [{"sku":"33HUDS","qty":"1","options":[{"id":"92","value":"20"},{"id":"140","value":"148"},{"id":"141","value":"30"}]}]
   -The query param: currency should be retrieved from the woocommerce
   -The query param: items: should be the item, from which page the "pay in 1 click" button was clicked on

Please do not give me an example of a plugin, but write a real plugin. Please adapt it as you like, if you can't adapt, just randomize some stuff. Please note that everything should be styled.
Please write what you understood and then give me the code.
Please do not stop writing the code and continue, i dont mind the long length.
Please also generate the styling. Please adapt it as you like, if you can't adapt, just randomize some stuff

-Resume where u left off

add this later manually
--On the woocommerce minicart widget, the original woocommerce checkout button should be replaced with a button called pay in 1 click

What are the features of the plugin?
--Should display a button on product page and checkout pay called pay in 1 click, near the add to cart button
--When clicked, it should add query params to a link: checkout.veryfast.com/ src=wc&merchantId&productId&qty=1&cartId=
--It should create an overlay after clicked
--The overlay should display the payment link in an iframe

React side:
-Payment link will fetch the productId from the query params
-it will display in cart
-after address is entered it will display available shipping methods

Express side:
-/getProduct route -> should fetch product data and locate with id
-/createOrder route -> after clicks checkcout, will create order
-/getStatus route -> will set order as compleete if success ,r will set order is failed

How will users control those features?
--The users will click

What input does the plugin need to accept from users?
--A product add to cart or click on the pay in 1 click button on the product page
What will the front-end design look like (if applicable)?
--Fast checkout
Will the plugin integrate with other plugins or services?
--The plugin will integrate with woocommerce
What potential compatibility issues might the plugin have?
--new woocommmerce version( new checkout APIs )

what i will do:
-pass the product id inside the link
-get the product id, data, from express
-get the data above, and insert into cart
